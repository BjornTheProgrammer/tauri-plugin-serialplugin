# Tauri `serialport` default permissions

This configuration file defines the default permissions granted
to the serialport.

### Granted Permissions

This default permission set enables all read-related commands and
allows access to the `$APP` folder and sub directories created in it.
The location of the `$APP` folder depends on the operating system,
where the application is run.

In general the `$APP` folder needs to be manually created
by the application at runtime, before accessing files or folders
in it is possible.

### Denied Permissions

This default permission set prevents access to critical components
of the Tauri application by default.
On Windows the webview data folder access is denied.
